- Download all the files and put them inside this folder location
  `<STEAM_FOLDER_LOCATION>\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\game\csgo\cfg\`
- Remember to replace `<STEAM_FOLDER_LOCATION>` with your Steam folder location
- Add the following code to your current autoexec file
    `exec de_subtick_01.cfg`

NOTE!!!

  In the new update on Oct 17th, Valve have implemented subtick to all alias commands, but this only affect alias ingame-action commands, not exec cfg file commands
  
  So when you use the alias "..." "exec ...cfg", you can still de subtick the game.
  
  Thank you @launders for the idea of desubtick-ing the game with a cfg file as he has demonstrated in his tweet
